      <h1>Junior Frontend Developer</h1>
      <img src="../src/images/PB.png" alt="Picture of Julia" />
      <p>I am a developer with a passion for everything technology. For my whole life technology played a big part and I've always found much joy in learning about everything tech. What I bring to a new team is the same relentless curiosity that helped me debug code late into the night for school-projects, the discipline to learn independently, and the proven ability to thrive under pressure. I’m eager to apply these strengths to build robust, user‑focused products at  my next job.</p>
